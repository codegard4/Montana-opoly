RULES OF THE GAME
-----------------

MONTANA-OPOLY vs MONOPOLY
Montana-opoly is meant to be a more intense, faster-paced version of Monopoly. Thus, it has distinct rules for turns, adding houses, trading, and determining who wins the game.

TURNS
- In Montana-opoly, a full turn occurs when every player has a chance to roll the dice.
- After each turn, the options bar unlocks and allows players to start a new turn, end the game, make trades, add houses to their properties, or view the rules.

To begin a new turn, select "New Turn" from the options bar.

ADD HOUSES
- Differing from regular Monopoly and to supplement the high-octane, high-stakes vision for Montana-opoly, players may add houses to their properties without needing full sets of properties
- Remember that Utilities and Mountain Ranges may not have houses placed on them, as their rent values are determined by dice rolls and number of ranges owned, respectively

To add a house to a property:
1. Select "Add Houses"
2. Select your token from the dropdown menu
3. Select the property that you would like to add a house to

TRADING
- Trading may be initiated by human players in between turns
- Trading occurs in property swaps, one property for another
- Trading does not involve cash considerations
- Trading may not occur between two bot players
- Bot players will not accept trades if they are too one-sided, so offer wisely.

To initiate a trade:
1. Select "Trade"
2. Select your token
3. Select the token of your trading partner
4. Select the property you would like to trade
5. Select the property you want in return
6. Confirm the trade

END OF GAME PROCESS
- The winner of Montana-opoly is the player who collects the greatest value of assets
- Properties are considered less valuable than cash, as properties are meant to be investments that generate rent for the player
- The game may be ended in between any turn by pressing the "End Game" or by completing all turns chosen during game setup

HAPPY PLAYING!
